# Islands (Client Components)
If you want to add interactions to your page, create Island components. Islands components should be:

- Placed under app/islands directory or named with $ prefix like $componentName.tsx.
- It should be exported as a default or a proper component name that uses camel case but does not contain _ and is not all uppercase.
